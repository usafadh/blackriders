# blackriders
This repo performs two analyses on Steven Crane's "Black Riders:"

* Semantic Analysis using lsa to find simularities across the poems in the corpus.

* Sentiment Analysis using syuzhet to discover sentiment associated with each of the poems

Resulting spreadsheets and graphs are in the results folder.

For a brief discussion of latent semantic analysis specific to the lsa package, please see https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lsa/lsa.pdf.

For background on the syuzhet package and using it for literary research, please see Jockers:
